# LLAnonymizer
A simple application to anonymize text before using Large Language models (AI) on the cloud.

It uses a technic called [Pseudonymization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization) to replace sensitive text with placeholders without changing the overall structure of sentences so that AI can still "understand" them.
